# InvoiceApp
Simple Vendor/Invoice app created only with React, React-Router and Vite. It was created from scratch with no templates for the forms, or invoices. It's a very simple app that could be use perhaps in an intranet setting using data from a company's DB. This DEMO has some data included that is downloaded to localStorage and used directly as a DB for demonstrating purposes without having to connect to a real DB.

The point of this app was to practice and showcase the use of several concepts that I've learned, and use it in a practical way and to be able to create and come with solutions from scratch.
